  title: Why Epubjs？
  description: >-
    Today, Hypothesis and our partners, NYU Press and NYU Libraries, the Readium
    Foundation, Evident Point and EPUB.js, are announcing the world’s first
    open-source, standards-based annotation capability in an EPUB viewer — or
    rather two EPUB viewers, because we’re launching with identical
    functionality in the two most popular open-source frameworks, Readium and
    EPUB.js. For the first time, publishers and others now have a complete
    annotation solution for all their content published in all three primary
    digital formats: HTML, PDF and now, EPUB.
description: >-
  This means that anyone who wants to make an annotatable EPUB available can do
  so using their choice of reading frameworks, giving readers the ability to
  take personal notes, group notes or have public discussions on top of the
  fastest growing web standard text format.

  heading: What we offer
  description: >
    Also, if cross-format identifiers like DOIs are used, annotations made in
    one format (eg, EPUB) can be seen in the same document published in other
    formats (eg, HTML, PDF) and in other locations. All annotation capabilities
    of Hypothesis, including groups, markup, rich media, math support, and more
    are now available across all three formats — HTML, PDF, and EPUB. For
    example, annotation groups active in different formats and different
    locations can be available to group members on the same documents accessed
    anywhere. Annotations that users make in EPUBs are searchable and
    discoverable together with all their annotations made in other documents and
    formats.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
